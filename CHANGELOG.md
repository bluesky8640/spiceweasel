# BACKLOG #

* Spiceweasel config file support (or just overload knife.rb?)
* make deletion smarter, use tags for providers
  * see if -P is supported?
* Librarian integration
  * load in the librarian file
  * output the knife commands
  * validate the librarian cookbooks vs. roles, environments and run lists
* EXTRACT EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE FROM CHEF SERVER (or just use knife download?)
 * knife batch extract to a tarball named for the organization
 * option to include credentials and knife.rb
 * translate json back to rb?
* do we need global use of the *_list attrs for later use?
* --simple mode to unroll multiple uploads per command?
 * ie. "knife cookbook upload apt\n knife cookbook upload ntp" instead of 1 liner
* do we need to support concept of Groups from Berkshelf, to allow uploading multiple versions of cookbooks?

## Targetted for 3.0 ##
* CONVERT TO A KNIFE PLUGIN
 * knife batch create from file infrastructure.yml
